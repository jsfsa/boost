# Boost.js

Boost.js is a Javascript code loader for Browsers.
It can be the basis for developing advanced Web Application frameworks.
It is asynchronous, but its style of modules is like Node.js for being convenient to organize very large-scale front-end code.
It uses Indexeddb internally to boost code loading efficiency.
So it also is a solution of the AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition).

###  Getting Started.

The Boost.js can be imported into HTML pages and Web Workers in your own web application.
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="boost.js" namespace="boost" baseon="resources/javascript" version_uri=".ver"></script>
```
The attribute "baseon" is the structured URL folder name for module javascript files. 

The attribute "src" is the URL of Boost.js. 

The attribute "namespace" is the function name of Boost.js in global javascript context. To avoid name conflicts with other framework, you can change it to another name like "require". 

The attribute "version_uri" is an URL, to use Indexeddb cache, It must be set. the content of "version_uri" URL should be a series of number. Once it be changed, then brower will clean all caches of modules and load an new version.
If you are developing a product, you don't need set it. In this case Browser will immediately load new version modules after some module files are changed. Befor you publish the product setting it Browser will use Indexeddb cache. Or make a new version_uri content each time after you change your code. The example code "UpVer.sh" is used to do it.
Alternatively, you can set the attribute "version" directly to replace the "version_uri". its content is the series of number also.
###  Load your modules.

```javasscript

boost(['module1','module2'], function(module1,module2){
   //todo: you want to do ...
});

```
### Define a module
Your module paths all base on the "baseon" URL.
example:
Set baseon="resources/javascript",then:
The real URL path of "module1" is "resources/javascript/module1.js".
The real URL path of "module1/module5" is "resources/javascript/module1/module5.js".

These "module1","module1/module5" are modules's ID.
If you want use the "module1/module5" in the "module1",you can write it in "module1.js" file.
```javascript
	require("module1/module5")
```
So the argument of require function in a module must be a module ID , Its real path base on the baseon URL.
So the file name of modules decide its module ID.

### How to export some things in a module.

While deine a moduel, every moduel can see two thing. 
The first one is the "require" function that is used to declare dependent modules.
The second one is thie "imports" Object that can be set anything in it for exporting them to outter invoker.
This is a simple module style for developers who like Node.js.
```javascrtipt
	exports.hi=function(){
		return "Hello World";
	};
```

### Namespace

The namespace is a MUST attribute.
Of cause, you can have two different namespaces.
For the second namespace , you have to define it in javascript code.

```javasscript
//AddNameSpace(boostname,baseonSrc,versionUrl,versionNumber,requireName,exportsName,BatchLoadingPackageUrl) // full arguments
	boost.AddNameSpace("boost2",baseon2,version_uri2);
	boost2(["m1","m2"],function(m1,m2){

	});
```
Now you can use "boost2" to load another different systematic javascript library.


### Postscript
Most JavaScript modules are defined in two ways: synchronous and asynchronous.
Asynchronous is best experienced in Browser. Like RequireJS. But writing code is tedious.
So I combine the advantages of Node.js and RequereJS to release Boost.js.

### Unusual Usage:
The attribute "require" : changing the "require" function name in module to other else.
The attribute "exports" : changing the "exports" Object name in module to other else.
Some people may not want to be confused with the style of node.js. they can use them.
The attribute "package" : loading package Url in batches, 
For large single-page applications, all modules to be used can be packaged in a fixed package according to a certain version in advance to speed up the first visit to the page.
About how to make a package ,Please refer to details in the "tools" folder.
Each package have an version number. If it different with the version number defined by the "version_uri" or "version" attribute, it wouldn't be apply even it has been download.Therefore, when making the package, pay attention to the version number.


### Web Workers

It's usage same as HTML pages, just that form have a little diffrent. 
```javasscript
   var myWorker = new Worker("../boost.js#main=worker.js&baseon=http://127.0.0.1:9999/resources/javascript&version_uri=.ver&package=packagecache.json");
```
The baseon, the main are MUST. the others same as HTML page's parameters.
One more note: All URL parameters are relative to the "boost.js" file, but they are relative to the HTML page URL while it be used to HTML page.

### Template support
Hybrid code has always stood on the mainstream in Web development. For example: PHP, JSP, ASP, React, Angular etc.
This shows that most Web applications do not need too elaborate technologyï¼Œ and Development efficiency is the most important.
I don't want to invent a new template-based syntax. In fact, HTML itself is Hybrid code.
So Boost.js can use HTML as a module.
Simply put, the scripts in HTML is the module code for Boost.js, and the other HTML code is template.
In this way, Boost.js also does not restrict you to use any template-based technology, while providing sufficient convenience.
```html
<div>
<h1>HTML Template</h1>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
	exports=function(){
		return _HTML_;
	};
</script>
```
The _HTML_ variable is the template string.
To use the html module, you need to add the ".html" suffix.
```javascript
require("module5.html")();/*will get the
"<div>
<h1>HTML Template</h1>
</div>"
*/ 
```
###  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
If you want to separate the client code of We app under another domain name.
You should Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for the "baseon" folder in your CDN website.

### Changelog
v2.3 :
	1) Support multi-level "baseon" URLs.
	2) Support WebWorker directly importScripts("boost.js");
	3) Fix bug for no InIndexedDb Cache(no version setting).
